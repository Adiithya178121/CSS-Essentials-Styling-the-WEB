    Microcontrollers generally can retain functionality while waiting for an event like a button 
    press or some other interrupt. Other microcontrollers may serve performance-critical roles 
    at which they may need to act more like a digital signal processor (DSP) than a 
    microcontroller, with higher clock speeds and power consumption.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    What a microcontroller does is, gathers input, process this information, and outputs a 
    certain action based on the information gathered by it. Microcontrollers usually operate at 
    lower speeds, around the 1MHz to 200 MHz range, and are designed to consume less power 
    because they normally are embedded inside other devices that can have greater power 
    consumptions than the MCU.

    A Microcontroller can be considered as the backbone of Embedded Systems and its most 
    important feature is the fact that "It can think". A Microcontroller may look like a simple 
    electronics chip, but itâ€™s way too powerful because it's programmable. Using a programming 
    code, we can control all I/O pins of a microcontroller and are used to perform multiple 
    functions. C and assembly languages are usually used for programming a microcontroller but 
    the HEX File which gets uploaded in microcontrollers is in machine language. There are also 
    other languages available for programming a microcontroller but beginners start with 
    assembly language as it provides a clear idea about the microcontroller's architecture.
