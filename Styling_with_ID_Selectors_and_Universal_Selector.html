  <h1 id="main-title">Water Quality Monitoring System</h1>
  <h2 id="subtitle">Ensuring Clean Water for All</h2>

  <p>Any contamination in the water body would affect the health of aquatic animals, plants, and humans. Water is used for different applications such as domestic consumption, agricultural activities, and industrial purpose. So, it's necessary to measure the purity level of water, which can be done using a water quality monitoring system.</p>

  <p>Mostly all the water monitoring systems will have 3 basic levels: Acquisition of Data, Transmission of Data, and Processing. The processed data is displayed to the end-user. Data can be acquired using a large number of sensor networks which can be either wired or wireless.</p>

  <p>Data can be transmitted using Ethernet, Coaxial cables, GSM, Zigbee, and Bluetooth. Processing is done with the help of IoT devices and monitoring tools. The water monitoring system measures the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the water parameters.</p>

  <p>To measure this parameter respective sensors are used such as pH sensor for measuring the pH value of water, Turbidity sensor to measure turbidity value, etc. pH defines the water whether it is acid, base, or neutral. Differences in pH can lead to the change of color, smell, and taste of the water.</p>

  <p>In general, the pH of clean water is between 6.5 and 9. pH of drinking water is 7 which is considered neutral. Turbidity measures the water cloudiness. Its unit is NTU and it is calculated by reading the optical properties of water. Usually, sensors are dipped into the water sample to measure the quality.</p>

  <p>This sensor network can be created in many ways. In our project, we are using ROUV (Robot) to create a sensor network.</p>
