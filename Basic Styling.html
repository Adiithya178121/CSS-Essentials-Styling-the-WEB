    <h1>Understanding Microcontrollers</h1>
    <h2>The Role of Microcontrollers in Embedded Systems</h2>

    <p class="first-paragraph">
        Microcontrollers generally can retain functionality while waiting for an event like a button 
        press or some other interrupt. Other microcontrollers may serve performance-critical roles 
        at which they may need to act more like a digital signal processor (DSP) than a 
        microcontroller, with higher clock speeds and power consumption.
    </p>

    <p class="second-paragraph">
        What a microcontroller does is, gathers input, process this information, and outputs a 
        certain action based on the information gathered by it. Microcontrollers usually operate at 
        lower speeds, around the 1MHz to 200 MHz range, and are designed to consume less power 
        because they normally are embedded inside other devices that can have greater power 
        consumptions than the MCU. A Microcontroller can be considered as the backbone of 
        Embedded Systems and its most important feature is the fact that "It can think". A 
        Microcontroller may look like a simple electronics chip, but itâ€™s way too powerful because 
        it's programmable.
